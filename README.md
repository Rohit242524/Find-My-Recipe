# 🍽️ Meal Recipe Finder

This project allows users to search for meals by entering ingredients and displays a list of matching recipes.  
Clicking on a recipe shows detailed cooking instructions, along with an image and a link to a video tutorial.  
It uses the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch and display recipe data.
